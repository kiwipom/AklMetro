# GridView done right

This is a sample app created on the fly at Auckland's [Metro Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Metro/) user-group on Wednesday, 25th July 2012.

The point of the demo was to show how the `GridView` control works, and how to get grouped data into it. We wanted to demonstrate how much simpler the Visual Studio templates could have been.


We then showed how to put two `GridView`s into the ZoomedIn and ZoomedOut half of a `SemanticZoom` control and linked them using a line of code-behind to set the ItemsSource of the ZoomedOut gridview.

If you wish to contribute a nicer looking ItemTemplate or two, contributions are welcome :-)
